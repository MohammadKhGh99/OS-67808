Q2:
advantages:
* by creating new process to each tab, each tab get to run independently from others.that is,
if any tab encountered problems it won't affect other tabs.
* When new processes are created, none of them have shared memory,and processes have more resources.
* Process can create multi-threads inside,thus get some advantages of multi-threaded programing.
* Failure in one process wont lead to failure in other processes.
Disadvantages:
* Requires more resources and memory than threads.
* larger overhead,Process Context switch has larger overhead than thread context switch.

Q4:
'real' time is continuous, it is ciunted in each process.
'virtual' time not continuous, it is counted during the time of the process active computation time.
real time example: the operating system clock application utilizes a real time
timer that keeps counting regardless of the process currently active.
virtual time example:o measure the runtime of a single process in order to analyze its own running time.
the scheduler algorithm uses virtual time to coordinate between two (or more) processes.
