mkdir("Welcome", 0775):
creates a directory named : Welcome
mkdir("Welcome/To", 0775):
creates another directory inside Welcome named To
openat(AT_FDCWD, "Welcome/To/OS2020", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666):
the directory TO is empty therefore this command creates a new file named OS2020
"A call to create() is equivalent to calling open() with flags equal to O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC"
write(3, "sarahhegazi\nIf you haven't read "..., 82) :

it writes the following: "username\n If you haven't read the <arguemnt>....( open the created file and write something)
close(3): close the file OS2020
unlink("Welcome/To/OS2020") :
delets the file OS2020
rmdir("Welcome/To/"):

In Short:
the program creates two directories Welcome/To, creates a file OS2020 write a string, then deletes
the file and the directories.
when running the program without any input it writes an error message:"Error.The program should receive a single argumen."
Note:i didn't mention fstat, i think it's not mandatory to describe what it does.
