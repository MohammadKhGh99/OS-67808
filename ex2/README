ANSWERS:
Part 2:
Q1:
A general and recommended use of user-level threads would be dealling with high amount of transitions,
for example using applications while playing music in the background or downloading something.
in this case using users-level thread is more efiicent because it takes less time, between the threads, than in the kernel mode.

Q2:
Disadvantages:
* It requires more resources and memory than threads.
* larger overhead,Process Context switch has larger overhead than thread context switch.

Advantages:
* In this way each tab runs independently, so any problem or error happens will affect just one tab and not all the tabs.
* Failing in one process will not affect the others.
* By creating a new processes, each one have a different memory so processes have more resources.
* Process can create multi-threads inside,so get some advantages of multi-threaded programing.

Q3:
We send external interrupt to the operating system, that
sends signal to the process, and the process handle the signal by terminating itself.

Q4:
'real' time is continuous, it is counted in each process.
'virtual' time not continuous, it is counted during the time of the process active computation time.

real time example: the operating system clock application utilizes a real time
timer that keeps counting regardless of the process currently active.
virtual time example:o measure the runtime of a single process in order to analyze its own running time.
the scheduler algorithm uses virtual time to coordinate between two (or more) processes.
