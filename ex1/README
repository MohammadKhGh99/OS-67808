Assignment 1:
First of all the program makes a new directory called Welcome, then it will create another directory in the Welcome
directory called To, then the program creates a file (if not exists) called OS2021 in To directory and opens
it in write only mode, then it will write in it the following message "mohammadgh\nIf you haven't read the course
guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n<the argument that has been given to the program>", then it
will close the file and remove the OS2021 file from the directory To then removing To and Welcome directories and
exiting th system.
If we run strace os WhatIDo without an argument a message appears saying "Error. The program should receive a single
argument. Exiting.\n"  then the message ": Success\n" and exit.
